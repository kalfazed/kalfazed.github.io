                                    During my master course, I studied the automatic compiler optimization.
                                    The research is about developing a compiler that can exploit the parallelism 
                                    of a program from both fine-grained and coarse-grained granularity to get the 
                                    best performance.

                            <p>
                                In Tier-IV, my main responsibility is to develop and deploy deep learning models that can run on hardware 
                                resources-limited edge devices, allowing for real-time inference. Specifically, I have worked on developing several 
                                LiDAR/Camera/Fusion models that perform multiple tasks while maintaining a small model size and limited parameters. 
                                These models are deployed using techniques such as quantization, pruning, and fusion. Additionally, I am also responsible 
                                for developing offline models with rich model structures to ensure that features can be exploited at a fine-grained level. 
                                Our ultimate goal is to ensure that even a small model running on an edge device can achieve nearly the same precision as 
                                the offline model, with the help of techniques to increase data. We refer to this as "Data Closed Loop."

                            <p>
                                T2 Auto is a startup company, where most of the software prototypes are under development. 
                                When I was in T2 Auto, I belong to the perception team and work as a Technical Lead to lead
                                the team from the aspect of both techniques and management. My job was to develop a training and 
                                deployment prototype of BEVFusion meta-architecture. Then optimized the model into NVIDIA 
                                architecture to make sure the inference time was fast. The BEVFusion model uses LiDARs and cameras 
                                as input sensors. I tried several different tactics to reach high precision and fast inference speed. 
                                For example, develop customized BEVPool methods to accelerate the projection from camera view to BEV 
                                grid, or use deformable attention as a substitute for BEV Pool.  <br><br>

                                Besides, in the aspect of deployment, I also develop some benchmark tools for both the training model and the deployed model. 
                                These benchmark tools contain layer-wise precision analysis, coarse/fine-grained speed analysis, and so on.

                            <p>
                                I am coaching an online class in China similar to "Udemy", and it offers a course related to "High Performance 
                                Implementation Using CUDA and TensorRT in Autonomous Driving". The motivation for starting this course is 
                                to help people quickly understand the key to reaching high performance in edge computing. Though this 
                                course mainly focuses on NVIDIA, the idea described in this course is also applicable to other edge devices.<br><br>

                                This course starts from the basics of parallel computing and computer architecture, such as describing how 
                                CUDA Core and Tensor Core work and using the "Roofline Model" to analyze the computation efficiency of operations. 
                                Then I go deep into the deep learning compilers and describe how these compilers optimize models, including showing 
                                the quantization and pruning algorithm, and analyze how to fix the precision drop after optimizations, and so on. 
                                Finally, I also show how to deploy various OSS SOTA models using CUDA acceleration methods and TensorRT API.

                            <p>
                                When I was in Honda, I was developing a multi-task DNN model for autonomous driving. The tasks include 
                                detection, segmentation, key-points, optical flow, and tracking. To train the network with 
                                resource resource-limited datasets, I tried to use several dataset enhancement techniques, such as active learning, 
                                and pseudo pseudo-labeling, to optimize the training. Recently, I have started developing BEV. 
                                The frameworks used are Darknet and PyTorch. <br><br>

                                Additionally, to perform real-time inference on in-vehicle hardware with limited computational 
                                resources, I optimized the perception's multi-task model to suit the hardware structure. I used C++ to perform 
                                parallel processing and asynchronous execution, used CUDA to speed up DNN pre-processing/post-processing, 
                                and used TensorRT to optimize each layer of DNN. I also created some custom DNN operations in C++ and CUDA 
                                to exploit higher parallelism. Other optimizations include reducing the size of the model using quantization 
                                , pruning and replacing low-density calculations with other calculations within the Transformer and CNN.

                                volatile memory(VM) and non-volatile memory(NVM). Proving the memory propagation of a parallel or concurrent 
                                program is a little bit tricky because of the non-deterministic behavior of the program. For example, in 
                                a concurrent program, the order of memory operation issues could be different from the order that these memory 
                                operations are done, and the order of status changes on hardware. It is common to use some synchronization methods
                                (barrier, fence, etc) to restrict the order so that the program behavior is deterministic somehow. However, an 
                                aggressive synchronization combination may lead to low performance of a program. As a result, the program cannot
                                benefit from concurrency. <br><br>

                                To handle this problem, I published an abstracted memory model to show the relaxed memory propagation flows, and a 
                                set of operational semantics to formulate the non-deterministic behavior of concurrent programs. I also proposed a 
                                mechanism to fully exploit the parallelism of memory propagation in concurrent programs, and prove the correctness 
                                of these programs mathematically. This research was finally published in a computer science journal and was awarded 
                                in the computer science academic community.

                            <p>
                                In 2018, being supervised by Prof. Hironori Kasahara, who was president of IEEE Computer Society and Vice president of 
                                Waseda University, I and some partners established the first IEEE HKN Chapter in Japan, named Mu Tau Chapter! <br><br>
                                
                                IEEE-HKN is short for IEEE Eta Kappa Nu, which is the honor society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),
                                and promotes excellence in the profession and in education with ideals of Scholarship, Character and Attitude. It 
                                recognizes outstanding students, alumni, and professionals who have made significant contributions to the fields of 
                                electrical engineering, computer engineering, and other IEEE-associated fields. IEEE HKN was founded on 28 October 1904, 
                                there are over 260 IEEE-HKN chapters worldwide, located at universities and colleges that have accredited programs in 
                                electrical and computer engineering and related fields. <br><br>
                                
                                I was president of Mu Tau Chapter, and our Chapter has achieved Key Chapter Status for 2019! We were invited 
                                to join HKN's Annual Student Leadership Conference, which was held in Nov 2019 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. We 
                                received an award at the conference there.

                                If a compiler can automatically parallelize a program, it is important to make sure the optimized program works the 
                                same as the one before the optimization. In industry, it is common to use unit tests to check the code is working 
                                correctly as expected by the programmer. However, it is nearly impossible to take over all the possible unexpected 
                                behavior and check the correctness, especially for corner cases. Different from the industry, it is generally known 
                                as a common approach in academia that uses mathematics to examine whether a compiler can maintain the correct behavior 
                                and meaning of a program. As long as we can abstractly define the grammar and semantics of parallel and sequential 
                                programs, and formally define the execution of programs, it is possible to logically infer the execution of parallel 
                                programs without running them indeed. <br><br>

                                During this period, I focused on the validation of a parallelizing compiler, which exploits the parallelism of a sequential 
                                program by using a set of techniques, such as calculating the Earliest Execution Condition (EEC) of different blocks in a 
                                program, pointer analysis, loop optimization, task fusion, and so on. This research was carried out jointly with INRIA 
                                in France and the University of Arizona in the United States, and the contributions were successfully presented at 
                                international conferences and in a journal.
