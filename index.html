                                <p>
                                    T2 auto is a startup company, where most of the software prototype is under development. When I am in T2 auto, 
                                    I belong to the perception team. My job is to develop a BEVFusion model and deploy the model into NVIDIA 
                                    architecture. The BEVFusion model uses LiDAR and camera as input sensors. I tried several different tactics 
                                    to reach high precision and fast inference speed. For example, develop customized BEVPool methods to accelerate 
                                    the projection from camera view to BEV grid, or use deformable attention as a substitute of BEV Pool.  

                                    Besides, in the aspect of deployment, I also develop some benchmark tools to both training model and deployed model. 
                                    These benchmark tools contain layer-wise precision analysis, coarse/fine-grained speed analysis, and so on.

                                <h3>Deep learning Engineer/Researcher, Honda Motor Co., Ltd., Intelligent Solution Laboratory</h3>
                                <p>
                                    When I was in Honda, I was developing a multi-task DNN model for autonomous driving. The tasks include 
                                    detection, segmentation, keypoints, optical flow, and tracking. In order to train the network with 
                                    resource limited dataset, I tried to use several dataset enhancement techniques, such as active learning, 
                                    pseudo labeling, to optimize the training. Recently, I have started developing BEV. 
                                    The frameworks used are Darknet and PyTorch. 

                                    Additionally, in order to perform real-time inference on in-vehicle hardware with limited computational 
                                    resources, I optimized perception's multi-task model to suit the hardware structure. I used C++ to perform 
                                    parallel processing and asynchronous execution, used CUDA to speed up DNN pre-processing/post-processing, 
                                    and used TensorRT to optimize each layer of DNN. I also created some custom DNN operations in C++ and CUDA 
                                    to exploit higher parallelism. Other optimizations include reducing the size of the model using quantization 
                                    and pruning, and replacing low-density calculations with other calculations within the Transformer and CNN.

                                    During this period, I focused on the research that allows programs running on non-volatile memory 
                                    to always maintain their correct program properties. I proposed a rational implementation 
                                    method and formally proved that a program based on this implementation method can always 
                                    operate correctly even in an uncertain execution environment, such as system crash. This goal 
                                    is achieved by abstracting the memory structure of non-volatile memory, expressing the operation 
                                    of memory propagation in a mathematical formula, and formally defining the grammar and semantics of 
                                    the program. This research was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal.

                                    In September 2018, IEEE's world-class student academic organization called IEEE Eta-Kappa-Nu was 
                                    founded as Japan's first IEEE student chapter (Mu-Tau Chapter) under Waseda University. I was 
                                    appointed as president in 2019. While enrolled, I was involved in various activities in 
                                    collaboration with student chapters in the United States and Europe, and won the Outstanding 
                                    Chapter Award in Boston, USA in November of the same year.

                                    By using mathematics to examining whether a compiler is able to maintain the correct behavior 
                                    and meaning of a program when it automatically parallelizes the program, it is possible to 
                                    logically infer the execution of parallel programs. After abstractly defining the grammar and 
                                    semantics of a program, the rationality of parallel program execution was formally defined, 
                                    and the program could be verified. This research was carried out jointly with INRIA in France 
                                    and the University of Arizona in the United States, and the contribution were successfully presented 
                                    at international conferences and in journal. In addition to research, I also provides research 
                                    guidance and experimental lectures for students.
