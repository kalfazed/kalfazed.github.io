                                    During my master course, I studied the automatic compiler optimization.
                                    The research is about developing a compiler that can exploit the parallelism 
                                    of a program from both fine-grained and coarse-grained granularity to get the 
                                    best performance.

                            <p>
                                T2 auto is a startup company, where most of the software prototype is under development. When I am in T2 auto, 
                                I belong to the perception team. My job is to develop a BEVFusion model and deploy the model into NVIDIA 
                                architecture. The BEVFusion model uses LiDAR and camera as input sensors. I tried several different tactics 
                                to reach high precision and fast inference speed. For example, develop customized BEVPool methods to accelerate 
                                the projection from camera view to BEV grid, or use deformable attention as a substitute of BEV Pool.  

                                Besides, in the aspect of deployment, I also develop some benchmark tools to both training model and deployed model. 
                                These benchmark tools contain layer-wise precision analysis, coarse/fine-grained speed analysis, and so on.

                            <p>
                                I am coaching an online class in China similar to "Udemy", and offers the cource related to "High Performance 
                                Implementation Using CUDA and TensorRT in Autonomous Driving". The motivation of starting this course is 
                                to help people can quickly understand the key to reach high performance in the edge computing. Though this 
                                course mainly focus on NVIDIA, the idea descirbed in this course is also appliable in other edge device.

                                This course starts from the basic of paralle computing and computer architecture, then go deep into the 
                                deep learning compilers and desribe how these compilers optimize model. Finally, I also shows how to deploy
                                various OSS SOTA models using CUDA acceleration methods and TensorRT API.

                            <p>
                                When I was in Honda, I was developing a multi-task DNN model for autonomous driving. The tasks include 
                                detection, segmentation, keypoints, optical flow, and tracking. In order to train the network with 
                                resource limited dataset, I tried to use several dataset enhancement techniques, such as active learning, 
                                pseudo labeling, to optimize the training. Recently, I have started developing BEV. 
                                The frameworks used are Darknet and PyTorch. 

                                Additionally, in order to perform real-time inference on in-vehicle hardware with limited computational 
                                resources, I optimized perception's multi-task model to suit the hardware structure. I used C++ to perform 
                                parallel processing and asynchronous execution, used CUDA to speed up DNN pre-processing/post-processing, 
                                and used TensorRT to optimize each layer of DNN. I also created some custom DNN operations in C++ and CUDA 
                                to exploit higher parallelism. Other optimizations include reducing the size of the model using quantization 
                                and pruning, and replacing low-density calculations with other calculations within the Transformer and CNN.

                            <p>
                                During this period, I focused on the research that allows programs running on non-volatile memory 
                                to always maintain their correct program properties. I proposed a rational implementation 
                                method and formally proved that a program based on this implementation method can always 
                                operate correctly even in an uncertain execution environment, such as system crash. This goal 
                                is achieved by abstracting the memory structure of non-volatile memory, expressing the operation 
                                of memory propagation in a mathematical formula, and formally defining the grammar and semantics of 
                                the program. This research was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal.

                                By using mathematics to examining whether a compiler is able to maintain the correct behavior 
                                and meaning of a program when it automatically parallelizes the program, it is possible to 
                                logically infer the execution of parallel programs. After abstractly defining the grammar and 
                                semantics of a program, the rationality of parallel program execution was formally defined, 
                                and the program could be verified. This research was carried out jointly with INRIA in France 
                                and the University of Arizona in the United States, and the contribution were successfully presented 
                                at international conferences and in journal. In addition to research, I also provides research 
                                guidance and experimental lectures for students.
